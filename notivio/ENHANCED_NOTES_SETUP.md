## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Groq API Key
1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_api_key_here
```

### 3. Restart Your Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Features

### Content Type Detection
The system automatically analyzes your video transcript and determines the best approach:
- **Educational**: Focus on learning objectives and assessment
- **Tutorial**: Emphasize step-by-step instructions and practice
- **Lecture**: Highlight academic rigor and theoretical frameworks
- **Journey**: Focus on insights and real-world applications
- **General Knowledge**: Emphasize facts and broader implications

### Enhanced Note Structure
Each generated note includes:
- **Structured Sections** with learning objectives and key insights
- **Comprehensive Summary** with key takeaways
- **Study Guide** with review questions, practice exercises, and memory aids
- **Key Concepts** with definitions, examples, and related terms
- **Interactive Quiz** with difficulty levels and explanations
- **Mnemonics** for better memory retention
- **Practical Applications** for real-world use

### Smart Fallbacks
If the Groq API is unavailable, the system automatically falls back to:
- Basic note generation using heuristics
- Structured content organization
- Essential study materials

## Usage

1. **Paste YouTube URL** - Enter any YouTube video URL
2. **Wait for Processing** - The system will:
   - Extract video transcript
   - Detect content type
   - Generate comprehensive notes using Groq AI
   - Structure content for optimal learning
3. **Review and Edit** - All notes are fully editable
4. **Download as PDF** - Export your notes for offline study

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/generate-notes` - Main notes generation endpoint
- `POST /api/video-transcript` - YouTube transcript extraction
- `POST /api/generate-pdf` - PDF export functionality

### AI Model
- **Model**: `llama3-8b-8192` (AI SDK 4 compatible)
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (for consistent, focused output)
- **Max Tokens**: 4000 (optimized for model compatibility)
- **Fallback**: Built-in heuristics for reliability

### Content Processing
- **Transcript Cleaning**: Removes timestamps, filler words, and video fluff
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detects and handles non-English content
- **Content Analysis**: Identifies key terms, concepts, and themes
- **Structured Output**: Generates organized, educational content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Groq API key not configured"**
   - Ensure `.env.local` file exists with `GROQ_API_KEY`
   - Restart your development server

2. **"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'completions')"**
   - ✅ **FIXED**: This was caused by incorrect Groq API integration
   - The system now properly uses `generateObject` from the `ai` package
   - No action needed from users

3. **"AI_UnsupportedModelVersionError: Unsupported model version"**
   - ✅ **FIXED**: Updated to use `llama3-8b-8192` which is compatible with AI SDK 4
   - The system now uses a supported model version
   - No action needed from users

3. **Language Issues**
   - ✅ **FIXED**: System automatically ensures English-only output
   - Non-English transcripts are processed to generate English notes
   - All generated content (questions, explanations, examples) is in English

2. **"Failed to generate notes"**   
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify Groq API key is valid
   - Check browser console for detailed errors

3. **Poor note quality**
   - Ensure video has clear, captioned content
   - Try videos with longer, more detailed transcripts
   - Check if content type detection is working correctly

### Performance Tips

1. **Video Selection**: Choose videos with:
   - Clear, well-captioned content
   - Substantial length (5+ minutes)
   - Educational or informative focus

2. **API Usage**: The system includes:
   - Intelligent fallbacks for reliability
   - Content type detection for better prompts
   - Efficient transcript processing

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your Groq API key is working
3. Ensure your video has available captions
4. Try with different video content

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- **Multi-language Support** - Generate notes in different languages
- **Custom Templates** - User-defined note structures
- **Collaborative Editing** - Share and edit notes with others
- **Progress Tracking** - Monitor learning progress over time
- **Integration** - Connect with learning management systems

---

**Note**: This enhanced system provides significantly better note quality compared to basic heuristics, making it ideal for students, professionals, and lifelong learners.
